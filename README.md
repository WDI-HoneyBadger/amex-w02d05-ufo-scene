# Making Alien Abduction Scene

## Description
Now you know about updating `positions`, manipulation the DOM and using `setInterval`, you can make an alien abduction scene ðŸ‘½!

You will need to design a logic for the scene so that when we press the start scene button a spaceship will come from the sky to abduct a human! the final scene should look like something like this [sample scene](img/scene.jpg)

I have provided some startup files with a nice assets from freepik.com

## Desired Functionality

1. Update the positions only using Javascript no CSS
2. Don't forget to resize, display, hide to make the scene more realistic  
3. Animate using setIntervals 

## Bonus 
I provided some cool particles img so you can make an effect, add them to the scene using Javascript no HTML
